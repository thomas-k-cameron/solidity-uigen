# Solidity-UIGEN

# What's This?
It creates GUI from your Solidity Code.

# Why should I use this?
1. It runs on your computer. Your private keys and other relevant data will never be stored outside your computer.  
2. It allows you to process your data in batch; Say you want to transfer 10,000 NFTs. You can simply create CSV file that specifies the parameter and feed it to the system. No need to click again and again and again.
